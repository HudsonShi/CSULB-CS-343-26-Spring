# CS 343: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Course Description:**
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and practices of software engineering. Students will move beyond simple programming to understand the entire software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and system design to implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The course covers modern processes, tools, and methodologies used in the industry to build robust, scalable, and maintainable software.

**Core Learning Objectives:**
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
*   Explain key software development processes like Agile and Scrum.
*   Elicit and document software requirements and model systems using UML.
*   Understand and apply fundamental software architecture patterns and object-oriented design principles (SOLID).
*   Implement various software testing strategies and understand the concept of technical debt.
*   Utilize essential modern tooling for version control (Git), dependency management (Maven), and CI/CD (Jenkins).
*   Discuss project management, risk management, and estimation techniques.

**Primary Toolchain:**
*   **Language & Ecosystem:** Java JDK 25, Spring Framework
*   **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
*   **Build & Dependency Management:** Apache Maven
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
*   **Modeling:** Draw.io, Mermaid.js
*   **Project Management:** JIRA, Confluence
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **CI/CD & DevOps:** Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus
